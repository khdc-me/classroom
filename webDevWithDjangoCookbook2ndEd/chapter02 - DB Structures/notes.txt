First thing to do when starting new app: create models that represent DB structure

mixin class is interface w/ implemented features
    - can be used in Django models for reusing generic functionalities in
        different models, multiple times.
    - keep model mixins in utils module
        - if creating reusable app, keep in reusable app (ie: base.py)

All fields of abstract classes are saved in same DB tbl as fields of extending
    model

get_absolute_url() method can be used in templates to preview the saved object
    - good practice to define this method for every model that has its own pg
    - returns URL path, not full URL

Always overwrite the get_url_path() method
