# Web Development with Django Cookbook - 2nd Edition

## What I expect to get out of this book
Having recently contributed to the [PySlackers Website](https://pyslackers.com) via GitHub, I had the opportunity to see how professionals set up and organize their web stack. It was a window into how others integrate Django with multiple databases, caching, automation, virtualization, docker, front-end frameworks, json, etc.

I am hoping that this book will fill in the gaps and explain why things are organized as they are and various scripts are tied together. I will be posting notes, exercises, and solutions in this repo, as I go through this book.
