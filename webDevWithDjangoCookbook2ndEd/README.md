# Web Development with Django Cookbook - 2nd Edition

## Goal
Learn Django -- specifically looking for an explain as to why things are organized as they are and how things are tied together.

## Notes
- Book is a couple of yrs old and uses Django 1.8 w/ Python 2.7 & 3.4. It was a good read and good for seeing how the recipes were implemented but didn't really teach me Django.
