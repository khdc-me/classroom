### Goal
By reading this book, I expect to learn the proper way to build REST APIs. I intend to integrate Docker-contained APIs running on AWS EC2 linux server, querying an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database in future projects.

## NOTES:
* Book examples use the built-in python's built-in `venv` for creating and managing virtual environments and packages. I've chosen to use pipenv instead.
