### Goal
Learn how to build REST APIs.

## NOTES:
* Book examples use the built-in python's built-in `venv` for creating and managing virtual environments and packages. I've chosen to use pipenv instead.

* Stopped using this book b/c there are errors in the examples and was unable to proceed past the 2nd chapter. Created issues in the code's GH repo but have gotten no responses. Am now working w/ another book.
