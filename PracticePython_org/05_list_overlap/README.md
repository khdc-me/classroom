# List Overlap  
Take two lists, say for example these two:  
> a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]  
> b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]  
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.  
  
Extras:  
1. Randomly generate two lists to test this  
1. Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)  
  
NOTE: My script contains 2 solutions, including a "1-line" solution to satisfy extra 3, but technically cannot be done in 1 line b/c the script needs a minimum of 2 lines (1 line for the import and another for the output & list handling). Additionally, according to a python programmer I asked to review my code, the 1-liner solution required for this exercise is "not pythonic".
