# List Comprehensions  
Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:  
> a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]  
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.  
  
NOTE: This actually has a min of 3 lines: 1 for declaring the list, a 2nd for the comprehension (creation of second list), and a 3rd for the output.
