# Decode a Web Page Two  
Using the requests and BeautifulSoup Python libraries, print to the screen the full text of the article on this website: http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture.  
  
The article is long, so it is split up between 4 pages. Your task is to print out the text to the screen so that you can read the full article without having to click any buttons.  
  
This will just print the full text of the article to the screen. It will not make it easy to read, so next exercise we will learn how to write this text to a .txt file.  
  
NOTE: The vanityfair article is no longer on multiple pages. While the main purpose of this exercise is to gain more web scrapping experience, I think being able to identify links and retrieving content from multiple urls is a key concept for the exercise. I modified the exercise and instead set out to create a text-based NYTimes browser/reader.
