# String Lists  
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)  

NOTE: I include 3 solutions in my script:
1. The 1st, my preferred method
1. The 2nd is a good tool to have
1. The 3rd is if the solution absolutely requires splicing (in this case, no real need for it). There are a multitude of possible solutions, including ones w/ 'for' loops, but it's likely not what this exercise intends to address.
