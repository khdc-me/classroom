# List Ends  
Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.  
  
NOTE: In addition to the instructions, I added a function that verifies that the list is a list of integers before it is looked at by the rest of the script.
