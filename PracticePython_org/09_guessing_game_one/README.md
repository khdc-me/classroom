# Guessing Game One  
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.  

Extras:  
1. Keep the game going until the user types “exit”  
1. Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.  

NOTE: Decided not to generate the random number in a new game until the user's response is obtained b/c it is possible for the user to want to exit the game, in which case it would be pointless to generate a number. So i wait until I know the user has submitted an actual guess.
