# Character Input  
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.  
  
Extras:  
1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)  
1. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (Hint: the string “\n” is the same as pressing the ENTER button)  
  
NOTE: Calculation will be off by a year if user's birthday has not passed in current year. A better solution might be to ask user for birth date instead of current age.
