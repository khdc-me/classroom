# List Remove Duplicates  
Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.  

Extras:  
1. Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.  
1. Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.  

NOTE: Only did extra 1 (used loop), as I feel comfortable using set() from using it in previous exercises.
