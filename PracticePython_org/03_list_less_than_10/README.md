# List Less than 10  
Take a list, say for example this one:  
> a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]  
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.  
  
Extras:  
1. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.  
1. Write this in one line of Python.  
1. Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.  
  
NOTE: I broke this up into 3 files:  
* The 1st (list_less_than10.py) for the orginal: take a list, iterarte through it, print values smaller than 10  
* The 2nd (list_less_than10v2.py) for extras 1 and 2  
* The 3rd (list_less_than10v3.py) for extra 3
