# Data Analysis
Earlier this year I took a Data Analysis course online (ended June 2017), in which we worked with data that was stored in databases and csv files.  
  
Analysis and visualization was done via Excel (advanced formulas, pivot tables, charts, dash boards), SQL was used for extracting records from databases, all data was stored locally in csv files before opening and vieweing in Excel.  
  
I will redo the assignments, using Python (without any data-related packages like PyNum or Pandas), and will display information via matplotlib.
