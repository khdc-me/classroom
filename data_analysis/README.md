Earlier this year I took a Data Analysis course online (ended June 2017) where we worked with data that was stored in databases and csv files.  
  
Analysis and visualization was done via Excel. SQL was obviously used for extrating records from databases, but data stored in csv files before opening and vieweing in Excel.  
  
I will redo the assignment, reading data and analyzing using Python (no data packages), and will display information via matplotlib.
